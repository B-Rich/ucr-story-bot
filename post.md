#How to write a thousand stories in seconds

If you're the kind of person who worries about your job when they read about bots writing stories or the kind who tweets something dumb after reading something like [this](http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/221669/washington-post-considered-using-robot-sportswriters/), stop.

Just stop. 

If a bot can write a better story than you can, it's not you: It's the story.

Given structured data and some time, a programmer can write a bot that can write stories. You can write a bot that can write stories with first-week-of-class programming skills. I can teach you how to write a bot that writes stories in a single blog post. In fact, let's do that. 

This bot is going to take some structured data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports and write a story that says crime was up or down in a community. This bot will do some math, craft a lead, throw in some context and lay out the trend. And it will do it for every city reporting data to the UCR in seconds.

Neat, eh?

What can this bot never do? Be human. Humans are flawed, empathetic, complex beings, and no bot will ever be able to capture the human experience through writing like a human can.

There is no algorithm for humanity. 

This bot will never put a human face on crime. It'll never challenge the police chief on her reasoning for crime going up or down. It'll never uncover cops re-classifying violent crimes to artificially drive crime down. It will never do any of these things. Ever.
